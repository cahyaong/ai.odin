# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Energy Restoration System extends the existing metabolism system by enabling entities to restore energy through harvesting and consuming berries from blueberry bushes. This system provides a sustainable energy source that allows entities to survive longer and creates more complex survival behaviors. The system builds on the existing VitalityComponent, TraitComponent, and MetabolismSystem while adding new HarvestableComponent and RejuvenationComponent functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player observing the simulation, I want entities to be able to harvest berries from bushes, so that they can restore energy and survive longer periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity with VitalityComponent is within harvest radius of a bush with HarvestableComponent THEN the entity SHALL be able to harvest one berry per tick
2. WHEN a bush is harvested THEN the bush's berry count SHALL decrease by one
3. WHEN a bush's berry count reaches zero THEN the bush SHALL be marked as empty and no longer harvestable
4. IF an entity's energy is already at maximum THEN the entity SHALL NOT attempt to harvest berries
5. WHEN an entity harvests a berry THEN the harvesting SHALL stop after one berry per tick to prevent overconsumption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player observing the simulation, I want harvested berries to provide energy to entities, so that entities can maintain their energy levels and continue surviving.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity harvests a berry THEN the entity SHALL immediately gain energy equal to the berry's rejuvenation value
2. WHEN an entity's energy increases from berry consumption THEN the energy SHALL be clamped to the entity's maximum energy capacity
3. IF an entity's energy would exceed maximum capacity THEN the excess energy SHALL be discarded
4. WHEN energy is restored THEN the entity SHALL continue normal metabolism processing in the same tick

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the energy restoration system to integrate seamlessly with existing ECS architecture, so that it maintains performance and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes energy restoration THEN it SHALL use the existing MetabolismSystem for integration
2. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL use the existing ComponentFactory and blueprint system
3. WHEN berries are harvested THEN the system SHALL maintain 60 FPS performance with 1000+ entities
4. IF no harvestable entities exist THEN the system SHALL skip processing efficiently without performance impact
5. WHEN processing harvesting logic THEN it SHALL use spatial queries to find nearby bushes efficiently

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want berry bushes and rejuvenation values to be configurable through blueprints, so that different entity types and bush types can have different properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a bush entity is created from blueprint THEN it SHALL load HarvestableComponent properties from blueprint parameters
2. WHEN a berry is consumed THEN the energy value SHALL be determined by blueprint configuration
3. WHEN blueprint parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible default values
4. IF blueprint parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log an error and continue with defaults
5. WHEN different bush types are defined THEN they SHALL support different berry amounts and harvest radii

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player observing the simulation, I want the energy restoration system to create realistic survival behaviors, so that entities make intelligent decisions about energy management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an entity's energy is low THEN the entity SHALL prioritize finding and harvesting berries
2. WHEN multiple entities are near the same bush THEN only one entity SHALL harvest per tick to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN an entity is at full energy THEN the entity SHALL ignore nearby berries and focus on other activities
4. IF no berries are available in the area THEN entities SHALL continue with normal behavior patterns
5. WHEN berries are consumed THEN the system SHALL support the existing AI decision-making processes
